# Classical-Computer-Vision-Algorithms

Implementing some of the well-known algrothims like: Sobel, Prewitt, Roberts and Canny for edge detection and Hough Transform for line detection. There are many helper functions like: rgb2gray, readImgClipped, imgShow, imgPadReflect, convolution2D, dnorm, gaussian_filter, non_max_suppression, _prominent_peaks and clip.

This notebook is implemented using python from scratch with the help of NumPy and MatPlotLib liberaries only.
